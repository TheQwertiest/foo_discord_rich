## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/TheQwertiest/foo_discord_rich/releases/latest): depending on your foobar2000 version you need either `foo_discord_rich-Win32.fb2k-component` or `foo_discord_rich-x64.fb2k-component`.
1. Install the component using the [following instructions](http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:How_to_install_a_component).
1. Make sure that Discord is configured properly:
    * If your Discord account is set to `Invisible`, Rich Presence won't be displayed.
    * The following two options must be enabled in `User Settings` (gear icon near your profile image):
        * `Activity Privacy` > `Share your detected activity with others`.
        * `Privacy & Safety` > `Activity Status` (this option is per-server).
    * Check that `foobar2000` was **NOT** added to `User Settings` > `Registered Games`. Remove it if present.
